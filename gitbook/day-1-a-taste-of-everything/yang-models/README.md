# YANG models

The first chapter will explain what YANG models are

You will explore some of the YANG models of the C9800 WLAN Controller by using the [https://yangcatalog.org](https://yangcatalog.org/) website, and by using the "YANG Suite" tool which is installed locally

In some of the later labs you will look up RESTCONF paths using one of these tools

Optional instructions in the last part of this section explain how to install YANG Suite on your Ubuntu server. It is not expected that you have time to do this within the deep dive time limit, but if you know that you will work a lot with YANG models it might be worth looking into either during or after the deep dive.
