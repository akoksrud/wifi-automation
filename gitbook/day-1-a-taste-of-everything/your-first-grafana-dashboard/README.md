# Your first Grafana dashboard

Open the Grafana website: <kbd>http://\<server-ip>:3000</kbd>  (notice HTTP, not HTTPS)

* If you have installed a TIG stack on your own Ubuntu server, use that IP
* If you will use a pre-installed TIG stack on a shared server, use that IP. Refer to the lab topology to find the IP to use.

{% hint style="info" %}
Don't use the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key without saving, you might have to do some work again. You will probably do just that, and THEN remember it to the next time you accidentally do it again :relaxed:
{% endhint %}

The first dashboard we will create will be an AP dashboard. On Day 2 you can explore other types of dashboards, and/or build further on this dashboard. If you work primarily with routers, switches, firewalls or other equipment that you have available, feel free to adapt to your liking. It might be easiest to do at least parts of the "hand-held" AP dashboard first.
