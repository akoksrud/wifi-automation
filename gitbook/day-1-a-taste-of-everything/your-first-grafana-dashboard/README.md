# Your first Grafana dashboard

Open the Grafana website: <kbd>http://\<server-ip>:3000</kbd>  (notice HTTP, not HTTPS)

* If you have installed a TIG stack on your own Ubuntu server, use that IP
* If you will use a pre-installed TIG stack on a shared server, use that IP. Refer to the lab topology to find the IP to use.

{% hint style="info" %}
Don't use the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key without saving, you might have to do some work again. You will probably do just that, and THEN remember it to the next time you accidentally do it again :relaxed:
{% endhint %}
