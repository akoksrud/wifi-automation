# Export as JSON

You can export your dashboard as JSON to move it easily between different instances.&#x20;

If you have setup your TIG-stack according to this guide, the data source will have a fixed name and ID. If you are going to use the JSON on a system not configured by using this guide, you will have to use the "Export for sharing externally" switch. It will remove the datasource references from the JSON, and you will select the correct datasource when you import the dashboard again.
