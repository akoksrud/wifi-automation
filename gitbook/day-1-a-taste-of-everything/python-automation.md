# Python automation

In this lab we will create a Python script that

* Connects to the WLC using RESTCONF
* Gets a table of currently connected APs on the WLC
* Saves the AP list as an Excel file

Make sure that you have completed the sections [explore-vs-code](explore-vs-code/ "mention") and [create-a-virtual-environment.md](create-a-virtual-environment.md "mention")
