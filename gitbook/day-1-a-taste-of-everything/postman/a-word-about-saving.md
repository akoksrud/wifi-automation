# A word about saving

Saving deserves its own chapter. It is very common to forget saving :relaxed:

This little orange dot means the file/tab/whatever is not saved. Later, you will also see a similar behavior in VS Code (only using a white dot instead).

Use Ctrl+S to save the current tab, or click this icon ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (18) (1).png>)

An example: When you run a RESTCONF call with variables from an environment, like <mark style="color:orange;">`{{host}}`</mark> or <mark style="color:orange;">`{{password}}`</mark> it will use the value from your SAVED file. So if you do changes in the environment, remember to save the tab
