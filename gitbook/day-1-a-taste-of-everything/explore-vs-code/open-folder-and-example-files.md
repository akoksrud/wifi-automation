Select (or type) the wifi-automation folder that was created when you used the "git clone" command in the pre-lab tasks

First, we will open the Ansible playbook in the examples folder. \
Go ahead and click the file `ansible-first-playbook.yml` by opening the explorer tab, expanding the "examples" folder, and clicking the file.&#x20;

You will see that in the lower right corner we will have some errors showing. That is because we haven't installed Ansible yet. We will do this later int he lab in the [ansible](../ansible/ "mention") chapter.

The seond example file we will open, is `python-hello-world.py` in the "examples" folder

In the lower right part of the VS Code window, you can see that Python is detected as the language for the file. We have not yet told VS Code which interpreter to use, so there is a warning box saying "Select Interpreter". We will fix this in the [create-a-virtual-environment.md](../create-a-virtual-environment.md "mention") chapter.
