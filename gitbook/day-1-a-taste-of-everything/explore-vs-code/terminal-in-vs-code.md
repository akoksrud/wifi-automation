# Terminal in VS Code

#### Open the terminal in VS Code

VS Code has a great built-in terminal which we will use. When working on a remote server, this is often convenient instead of having a separate SSH client that you connect. Depending on if you customized your shell or not, it might look different from the screenshots. The content should be the same.&#x20;

Open the VS Code terminal by going to Terminal -> New Terminal (notice the hotkey to later, you will probably not have the insane Norwegian "Ã¸" character as your hotkey)

The code window will split, and you will have a terminal in the lower half of the screen
