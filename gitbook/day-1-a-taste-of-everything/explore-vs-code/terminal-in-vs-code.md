# Terminal in VS Code

#### Open the terminal in VS Code

VS Code has a great built-in terminal which we will use. Depending on if you customized your shell or not, it might look different from the screenshots. The content should be the same. Open the VS Code terminal by going to Terminal -> New Terminal (notice the hotkey to later, you will probably not have the insane Norwegian "Ã¸" character as your hotkey)
