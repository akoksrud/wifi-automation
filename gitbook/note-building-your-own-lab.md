# Note: Building your own lab

Based on feedback from running this deep dive on previous events, if you are going to build and troubleshoot the full lab setup, it will take most or all of the time (2x 3h)

The deep dive itself will have pre-built and pre-configured+tested WLAN Controllers (1 WLC per 2-4 students) for you to use. If you want to install your own WLC by following the optional part of this pre-lab guide that is OK, but we strongly encourage you to use the deep dive time to do actual automation exercises and not troubleshooting your WLC

There will also be pre-built Ubuntu servers to use, running on our servers, for those who want to use that instead of their own laptop.

If you have a mini computer or an old laptop to spare, you could install Proxmox on that and use for your VMs. Unfortunately it is outside the scope of this deep dive and this pre-lab guide to give detailed instructions on the Proxmox installation itself, outside what is described in task 1d. It is also outside the scope of the deep dive to help troubleshoot your Proxmox. But our servers run on that, so we are somewhat familiar with it and might answer some simple questions :relaxed:

We will also provide pre-built images with a finished installation of Ubuntu Server for Hyper-V and Virtualbox

We encourage you to install your own Ubuntu Server, since it will give you more experience building the items yourself when you get home or need it in some other situation
