# About day 2

Day 2 of the deep dive will contain lots of exercises for each of the topics you touched in the Day 1 content.&#x20;

The GitBook documentation for this deep dave is based on the Powerpoint slides from WLPC Prague'24 and Phoenix'25. The Day 2 content is still not fully converted from Powerpoint to GitBook, so please have a look at the Powerpoint slides until the material is fully converted. You can download it from GitHub on [https://github.com/akoksrud/wifi-automation/tree/main/presentations](https://github.com/akoksrud/wifi-automation/tree/main/presentations)

You should have completed relevant parts of Pre-lab tasks and Day 1 exercises.

For each exercise, we will try to do the following

* Tasks
  * One or more slides, with one or more tasks
* Expected output
* Hints
  * One or more slides, with hints or code snippets to get you in the right direction
* Example solution
  * An example solution (Note that most exercises will have many possible solutions that are better than the example)
* Example output

Note on error handling:&#x20;Examples in this lab will have minimal error handling to keep the examples small and readable. Depending on the usage (one-off vs. a recurring operations script) you will want some error handling.
