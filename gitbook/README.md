Welcome to the documentation for the Wi-Fi Automation Deep Dive.

The material have been developed for a format of 2x 3h sessions at [WLPC](https://www.thewlpc.com/). It has been presented at WLPC 2024 in Prague, and WLPC 2025 in Phoenix. I have also presented the material as an internal class in my company. If you want to use the material for similar activities, please contact me :relaxed:

The deep dive is organized as follows:

* Prequel: Just some informational stuff
* Pre-lab tasks: Appx 1-2h preparations (installing apps, checking that you have accounts etc)
* Day 1: Appx 3h "taste of everything", that is primarily Ansible, Python and Grafana stuff
* Day 2: "Unlimited" hours of more labs within each topic. Some prefer to spend more time on day 1 tasks on day 2 as well, that is perfectly fine :relaxed:
